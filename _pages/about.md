# About Me

I serve as an Assistant Professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Prior to my current role, I held the position of Assistant Professor (Research) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University's School of Accounting and Finance. I also bring experience as an equity research analyst from Citibank (Hong Kong), where I specialized in China's automotive and auto parts sectors, providing advisory support to top hedge funds and global institutional clients.

My academic credentials are robust; I hold a Ph.D. in Law and an M.Sc. in Finance from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, complemented by an LL.M. in International Commercial Law from University College London. My academic journey includes valuable experience gained during brief training at Oxford Law School and a visiting period at the Harvard Institute for Global Law & Policy. In the academic year 2018-19, I was honored with the J. William Fulbright Visiting Scholar appointment at Cornell Law School.

My research spans across AI Governance, Legal Tech, and the intersection of Law and Finance. I have demonstrated a strong aptitude for securing research funding, having played a pivotal role in acquiring grants totaling over 6 million HKD by the end of 2023. Beyond academia, I contribute my expertise to the discourse on innovation and technology development in the Greater Bay Area, with my analyses and opinions featured in the South China Morning Post, China Daily, and various esteemed media outlets.
